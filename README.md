# Collatz
The [Collatz Conjecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collatz_conjecture) is a mathematical conjecture that is simple in nature but seemingly impossible to prove. The problem is as follows:

Let *f(n)* be a function such that if *n* is odd, then *f(n) = 3n + 1* and if *n* is even then *f(n) = n/2*. Then for all positive integers *n*, applying *f* recursively will eventually converge to one. 

**Example**<br/>
Let *n = 5*. Then:
<br />
f(5) = 5 * 3 + 1 = 16 <br/>
f(16) = 16 / 2 = 8 <br/>
f(8) = 4 / 2 = 2 <br/>
f(2) = 2 / 1 = **1** <br/>
